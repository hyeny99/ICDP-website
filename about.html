                        <h1>WHAT IS ICDP?</h1>
                        <p>Hello, thank you for visiting ICDP website. If you are wondering what ICDP is and wants to join us, you've come to the right website. ICDP stands for 'I Can Do Programming'. This is a computer science club run by the organizer, Hyewon Jeon, and it is open to everyone.
                           We are programmers, computer scientists, and computer lovers.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Here's how and what we do</h2>
                        <p>We have regular meetings almost weekly basis. Currently, due to the coivd outbreak, club meetings happen via zoom.
                        We do well-structured and various activities through meetings. The meetings are mainly about how to program or build an application in the most popluar programming languages: C, Java, Javascript, HTML, Python, etc. 
                        Our goal is to have a good understanding of overall computer science topics using slides, resources and textbooks.</p>

                        <h1>EXAMPLES AND SOURCE CODES</h1>
                        <p>Improve yourself with numerous examples and (open) source codes we provide! Are you having a hard time finding good programming examples and practice problems?
                            We disucess problems and share codes during meetings. To come up with a better algorithm, we develop programs on our own and ask others' opinions. Not only indivisual works, we organize group projects as well.
                         We provide high quality problems and source codes that will definitely bring value to your programming projects.</p>

                        <h2>Current group project</h2>
                        <p>
                            The most recent project we have been working on is 'making a webpage using HTML or graphicQL'.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Your code is not working?</h2>
                        <p>Ask your club members for help! Always keep in mind that there is no "right" answer when it comes to programming.
                            The important thing is to look for others' codes and take these as references to improve your codes.
                            If you are stuck at your code or got an error and don't know how to fix it, you can always knock on the doors and simply ask the club members for their methods.
                            We have a group chat which is managed and checked 24 hours.
                        </p>

                        <h2>I have no background knowledge. Can I still join?</h2>
                        <p>The answer is yes. You are always welcome. It doesn't matter how "good" you are at programming or how "well" you know about Computer Science.
                            If you are passionate about learning Computer Science or if you realize how fruitful this field is, you can join ICDP anytime, anywhere.
                        </p>
